1- Go to PortalMed and open PortalMed.sln.
2- Change the appsettings.json DefaultConnection IP to your IP.
3- Run Update-Database on PMC (Package Manager Console) pointing to DOMAIN project.
4- Test the EndPoints and be happy.

Note: i'm note sure about how i should send you my Docker Image. So, if you want to see it, just ask me for e-mail i will run to send you that.

I appreciate your time, best regards.
